# SQL  Basic knowledge
Databaseï¼š a container to keep structured data
Database Management System(DBMS): a database software to create or manipulate data
Schema: a logical structure of a database, recording database info and table layout info.

Column: a field in a table
Row: a record in a table
## A table consists of one or more columns. 
## A table stores data by rows.

SQL (Structured Query Language): a language specifically used to communicate with databases.
MySQL: One of the DBMS based on Client-server software 
Relation: MySQL < DBMS based on Client-server software (Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server) < DBMS
## SQL not used in specified a DBMS = almost all DBMS support SQL
## SQL syntax is not quite the same between any two DBMSs.

---------------------

# IP Lookup
Mac:  # ifconfig - eno - inet
Linux: # ifconfig | grep "inet" 
Windows: ipconfig - IPv4 Address

# Steps:
Connecting MySQL needs: IP + Port + User_name + Password
Default Port: 3306

# Lookup all open ports in Linux
# lsof -i -P -n
# lsof -i
-i: list all files
-P: Forbid Port numbers to transform to Port names, such as forbidding 3306 transforms to MySQL
-n: Forbid IP to transform to hostname (This is not available by default)


Select database: # USE database1;
Show databases/table/field : 
# SHOW Databases;
# SHOW Table
